# [Daily Steps Visualization Dashboard in Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pranjalinaik/viz/StepsCounterSunburst/StepsWalkedSunburst)

Welcome to the Daily Steps Visualization Dashboard project! This repository features a Tableau visualization designed to display daily step counts throughout a year using a sunburst chart. The dashboard helps users track their daily physical activity, with color-coding to highlight days with higher step counts. Additionally, the dashboard includes a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) displaying the average steps walked per day across the year.

## Features:

- **Sunburst Chart:** Visualize daily step counts in a circular, hierarchical layout. Each segment represents a day, with color intensity indicating the number of steps walked.
- **Average Steps KPI:** Display the average number of steps walked per day throughout the year as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI).

## Getting Started

To get started with the Daily Steps Visualization Dashboard, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Tableau Desktop**: Ensure you have Tableau Desktop installed. If not, download and install it from the [Tableau website](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop).

### Usage

1. **Explore the Sunburst Chart**

   - View the daily steps walked in a year represented in a sunburst chart.
   - Hover over or click on segments to see detailed step counts for specific days.
   - The color gradient highlights days with higher step counts, providing a clear visual representation of activity levels.

2. **Review the Average Steps KPI**

   - Check the average number of steps walked per day for the entire year displayed prominently as a KPI.
   - Use this information to gauge overall activity levels and set goals.

3. **Interact with the Dashboard**

   - Utilize filters and interactive elements to focus on specific months or periods.
   - Explore patterns and trends in your daily activity throughout the year.

4. **Save and Share**

   - Save your work as a Tableau Packaged Workbook (`.twbx`) or Tableau Public (`.tde`) file.
   - Share your findings with others or include the visualizations in reports.

## Data Structure

The dashboard expects a data source with the following structure:

- **Daily Steps Data:** Columns for Date and Steps.
- **Date Format:** Ensure the date format is consistent with the Tableau date field requirements.

Ensure your dataset matches this structure for accurate visualization and analysis.
